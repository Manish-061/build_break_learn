# Build • Break • Learn

This repository is a **daily engineering log** where I document what I revise, build, and understand deeply as a backend & AI focused developer.

The goal is simple:
- Strengthen fundamentals
- Build consistency
- Think clearly about *why* things work, not just *how*


---

## 📌 Why this repository?

I realized that real improvement comes from:
- Revisiting fundamentals regularly
- Writing things down clearly
- Building the habit of disciplined learning

By maintaining this repository:
- I stay accountable
- I track my progress over time
- I build a public record of my learning journey

## 🛠️ How I use this repository

- Each day represents intentional learning or revision
- Concepts are revisited with examples and notes
- Over time, this will grow into a strong reference base

This repository will continue to evolve as I:
- Add more Java topics
- Build small experiments
- Move towards backend systems and real-world use cases

---

## 🚀 Long-term Objective

To become a strong software engineer who:
- Understands fundamentals deeply
- Writes maintainable, readable code
- Builds systems that solve real-world problems

Consistency over intensity.  
Progress over perfection.
